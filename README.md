# Climber Compete

## Background

A web app to allow rock climbers to have friendly competitions between each other. Users setup competitions between one another to see who can finish the most climbs in a 3 month period or who can get to 50 climbs first. The app then uses the [Mountain Project Data API](https://www.mountainproject.com/data) to gather stats on climber's Mountain Project ticks (climbs) to determine who wins and facilitate the competition.

Built with Rails 5, Ember, Postgres, and Sidekiq.
